KISS STRIP POKER

a free & opensource strip poker game engine made with Freebasic and Python , based on the Kiss Strip Game Engine (KSGE) and other opensource projects

This game is realized with those goals:
- a simple and light weight game with a minimal and easy to use user interface
- simple/minimal gameplay, no virtual money or fiches, just win 3 poker hands in a row (you can customize how many) to make opponent remove a piece of cloth. 
- this game tries to simulate how would be a real 121 strip poker game; let's imagine a similar situation in real life: you really think you will use money or fiches for a 121 real game?
- free & opensource so the game can be changed and improved by anyone!
- a dream that becomes true!!

if you are a video maker or photographer and you want to realize a strip poker game with your own material now you need just to use your skils and creativity to produce the videoclips, wich should be the best part of the job for you, just produce clip files and order/name them correctly consulting the KISS STRIP POKER MAKER GITHUB PAGE and the KISS STRIP GAME ENGINE GITHUB PAGE. You havn't to learn to code.

search the web for full working demostrations of the game and forks.

good luck & good vision ;)
