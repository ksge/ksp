KISS STRIP POKER

a free & opensource strip poker game and engine made with Freebasic and based on the Kiss Strip Game Engine (KSGE) and other opensource projects

This game is realized with those goals:
- a simple and light weight game with a minimal and easy to use user interface
- simple/minimal gameplay, no virtual money or fiches, just win 3 poker hands in a row (you can customize how many) to make opponent remove a piece of cloth. 
- this game tries to simulate how would be a real 121 strip poker game; let's imagine a similar situation in real life: you really think you will use money or fiches for a 121 real game?
- free & opensource so the game can be changed and improved by anyone!
- a dream that becomes true!!


HOW TO EASILY CREATE YOUR OWN STRIP POKER GAME
if you are a video maker or photographer and you want to realize a strip poker game with your own material now you need just to use your skils and creativity to produce the videoclips, wich should be the best part of the job for you, then download the Kiss Strip Poker main game and then:

- create clips (.mkv), name them in the right way, check https://github.com/ksge/ksge for more informations about how to name clips; It's highly recommended to use homogeneous clips, if possible every clip should have the same characteristics, the same resolution, the same codec, the same framerate...

- look for "opponents" folder of the game, use copy and paste to clone a free opponent folder such as Julia-Chang, rename the cloned folder with the name of your model
- inside the just created folder:
	- delete all the .mkv clips and replace with your own clips
	- replace also the .bmp image file with your own
	- if you want replace the .ogg file with your music
	- rename .bat and .sh files with the same name used for folder, keep attention with uppercases
	- edit .bat and .sh files and change again the name as done before, still keep attention with uppercases
you are ready to play your own strip poker game! just run the game launcher and if you have done right you will find your model.
