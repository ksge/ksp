KISS STRIP POKER

a free & opensource game made with Freebasic and Python , based on the Kiss Strip Game Engine (KSGE) and other opensource projects

This game is realized with this goals:
- a simple game with a minimal user interface; unlike most strip poker/blackjack games the user interface takes only a little portion of the screen, plus it can be moved everything you prefer. This would be surely a good thing for who thinks that in a strip game all the care should be granted to the multimedia content (videoclips), so most of the screen should be taked by the opponent videoclip and not by the poker cards!!
- also fiches are totally unuseful/boring in a strip game; in most similar games opponents starts with an amount of money or fiches and you have to let her lost it prior to remove  a piece of cloth. In Kiss Strip Poker you can choose to play a piece of cloth per hand, or (reccomended) if you want a more intrigant game you can choose to win a piece of cloth after 2 or more winning hands in a row. Maybe the best is to use 3 winning hands in a row to enjoy all the videoclips that can be put in the game for all the situations of a strip game; this game tries to simulate how should be a strip poker game in real life against one opponent; like should do most of similar games, let's image a similar situation in real life: you really think to use money or fiches for a 121 game?
- free & opensource so the game can be changed and improved!
- a dream that becomes true!!

if you are a video maker or photographer and you want to realize a strip poker game now you need just to use your skils and creativity to produce the videoclips, wich should be the best part of the job for you, just produce clip files and order/name them correctly consulting the KISS STRIP GAME ENGINE GITHUB PAGE.
